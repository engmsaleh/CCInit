# CCInit

CCInit is CatCyborg's boilerplates for iOS, Ruby on Rails, and Middleman static site projects. It is a summary of things CatCyborg copy-pasted when she starts doing sudden projects that come out of the rainbow land. So, CCInit might not be useful for you, but feel free to check it out anyway.
