# CCInit

CCInit is CatCyborg's boilerplates for iOS, Ruby on Rails, and Middleman static site projects. It is a summary of things CatCyborg copy-pasted when she starts doing sudden projects that come out of the rainbow land. So, CCInit might not be useful for you, but feel free to check it out anyway.

# Usage

Clone this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/catcyborg/CCInit.git
```

Then pick a project template to be initialized.

## iOS

TODO

## Rails

```
rails new rainbow_dog_api -J -D postgres -T -m rails/api_with_admin/template.rb
```

Replace `rainbow_dog_api` with your app name, of course.

## Middleman

TODO
