# CCInit

CCInit is CatCyborg's boilerplates for iOS, Ruby on Rails, and Middleman static site projects. It is a summary of things CatCyborg copy-pasted when she starts doing sudden projects that come out of the rainbow land. So, CCInit might not be useful for you, but feel free to check it out anyway.

Search for "catcyborg" usage and replace it with your project name.
